`Nebula-Up` is PoC utility to enable developer to bootstrap an nebula-graph cluster with nebula-graph-studio(Web UI) + nebula-graph-console(Command UI) ready out of box in an oneliner run. All required packages will handled with `nebula-up` as well, including Docker on Linux(Ubuntu/CentOS), Docker Desktop on macOS(including both Intel and M1 chip based), and Docker Desktop Windows.

Also, it's optimized to leverage China Repo Mirrors(docker, brew, gitee, etc...) in case needed enable a smooth deployment for both Mainland China users and others.

macOS and Linux with Shell:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/wey-gu/nebula-up/raw/main/install.sh | bash
```

Windows with PowerShell(Working In Progress):

```powershell
iwr https://github.com/wey-gu/nebula-up/raw/main/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

TBD:
- [ ] Finished Windows(Docker Desktop instead of the WSL 1&2 in initial phase) part, leveraging chocolatey package manager as homebrew was used in macOS
- [ ] Fully optimized for CN users, for now, git/apt/yum repo were not optimised, newly installed docker repo, brew repo were automatically optimised for CN internet access
- [ ] With nebula-graph version specification support, now it's hardcoded in 2.0.0-GA
- [x] With uninstall/cleanup support
- [ ] Packaging similar content into homebrew/chocolatey?
- [ ] CI/UT
