> ChatGPT and Nebulagraph Predict Fifa World Cup

[TOC]

<h2 id="the-hype" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-hype" class="header-mark"></a>1 The Hype</h2><p>In the hype for FIFA 2022 World Cup, when I saw <a href="https://cambridge-intelligence.com/fifa-world-cup-2022-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post from Cambridge Intelligence</a>, where they leveraged limited information and correlations among players, teams, and clubs to predict the final winner team, I always would like to try similar things with NebulaGraph to share the ideas of graph algorithm to extract hidden information from the overall connections in a graph in the community.</p>
<p>The initial attempt was to make it done in like 2 hours, but I noticed the dataset need to be parsed carefully from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_squads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a> and I happened to be not good at doing this job, so I put the idea on hold for a couple of days.</p>
<p>In the meantime, another hype, the OpenAI ChatGPT was announced, as I had been a user of DALL-E 2 already(to generate feature images of my blog posts), I gave it a try very quickly, too. And I witnessed how other guys(via Twitter, blogs, hacker news) tried to convince ChatGPT to do so many things that are hard to believe they could do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help to implement a piece of code at any time</li>
<li>Simulate any prompt interface: shell, python, virtual machine, or even a language you create</li>
<li>Act out almost any given persona, and chat with you</li>
<li>Write poetry, rap, prose</li>
<li>Find a bug in a piece of code</li>
<li>Explain the meaning of a complex regular expression/Open Cypher Query</li>
</ul>
<p>ChatGPT&rsquo;s ability to contextualize and understand has never been greater before, so much so that everyone is talking about a new way of working: how to master asking/convincing/triggering machines to help us do our jobs, better and faster.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I commented on this tweet, where they taught ChatGPT how to draw and render basic SVGs, then they started to ask him/her to draw any other complex things just after him/her learned in one second, that it&rsquo;s just like Kame-sennin(human) teaches Sun Wukong kung fu as a young <strong>Saiyan</strong>.</p>
<p>Be sure to check this Twitter thread, it&rsquo;s really interesting!</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey, cool, directly rendering SVGs in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChatGPT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ChatGPT</a> ! <a href="https://t.co/VQX9kYIrxT">pic.twitter.com/VQX9kYIrxT</a></p>&mdash; Br⍼d Skᔱggs (@brdskggs) <a href="https://twitter.com/brdskggs/status/1599533975357095936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>So, after trying to get ChatGPT to help me write complex graph database query statements, explain the meaning of complex graph query statements, and explain the meaning of a large chunk of Bison code, and he/she had done them WELL, I realized: why not let ChatGPT write the code that extracts the data for me?</p>
<h2 id="grabbing-data" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#grabbing-data" class="header-mark"></a>2 Grabbing data</h2><p>I really tried it and the result is&hellip; good enough.</p>
<p>The whole process was basically like a coding interviewer, or a product manager, presenting my requirements, and ChatGPT giving me the code implementation. I then try to run the code, find the things that don&rsquo;t make sense in the code, point them out, and give suggestions, and ChatGPT really understands the points I point out and makes the appropriate corrections, like:</p>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/chatGPT-correction-process.webp" title="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/chatGPT-correction-process.webp" data-thumbnail="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/chatGPT-correction-process.webp">
        
    </a></p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t list this whole process, but I share the generated code and the whole discussion <a href="https://gist.github.com/wey-gu/78cb28bee130966e7d6e9d573b51deff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>The final generated data is a CSV file.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Raw version <a href="https://github.com/siwei-io/talks/files/10152775/world_cup_squads.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world_cup_squads.csv</a></p>

<p>Manually modified, separated columns for birthday and age <a href="https://github.com/siwei-io/talks/files/10152923/world_cup_squads.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world_cup_squads_v0.csv</a></p>
<p>It contains information/columns of team, group, number, position, player name, birthday, age, number of international matches played, number of goals scored, and club served.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t care about the process, just go to the <a href="#Result" rel="">predicted result</a> directly.</p>
<h3 id="graph-modeling" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#graph-modeling" class="header-mark"></a>3.1 Graph modeling</h3><blockquote>
<p>Prerequisites: This article uses <a href="https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NebulaGraph</a>(Open-Source) and <a href="https://docs.nebula-graph.io/3.3.0/nebula-explorer/about-explorer/ex-ug-what-is-explorer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NebulaGraph Explorer</a>(Proprietary), which you can request a trial of on <a href="https://go.aws/3VZay2I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Graph Modeling is the abstraction and representation of real-world information in the form of a &ldquo;vertex-&gt; edge&rdquo; graph, in our case, we will project the information parsed from Wikipedia as:</p>
<p>Vertices:</p>
<ul>
<li>player</li>
<li>team</li>
<li>group</li>
<li>club</li>
</ul>
<p>Edges:</p>
<ul>
<li>groupedin (the team belongs to which group)</li>
<li>belongto (players belong to the national team)</li>
<li>serve (players serve in the club)</li>
</ul>
<p>The age of the players, the number of international caps, and the number of goals scored are naturally fit as properties for the player tag(type of vertex).</p>
<p>The following is a screenshot of this schema in NebulaGraph Explorer (will just call it Explorer later).</p>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/schema_fifa.webp" title="schema_fifa" data-thumbnail="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/schema_fifa.webp">
        
    </a></p>
<p>Then, we can click the save icon in the upper right corner and the button: <code>Apply to Space</code>  to actually create a graph space with the defined schema</p>

    </a></p>
<p>Click Import, we then import the whole graph to NebulaGraph, and after it succeeded, we could also get the whole CSV &ndash;&gt; Nebula Importer configuration file: [nebula_importer_config_fifa.yml](<a href="https://github.com/siwei-io/talks/files/10164014/config" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/siwei-io/talks/files/10164014/config</a> _fifa.yml.txt), so that you reuse it in the future whenever to re-import the same data or share it with others.</p>

<h3 id="explore-the-graph" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#explore-the-graph" class="header-mark"></a>3.3 Explore the graph</h3><p>Let&rsquo;s see what insights we could get from the information/ knowledge in form of a graph.</p>
<h4 id="querying-the-data" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#querying-the-data" class="header-mark"></a>3.3.1 Querying the data</h4><p>We could start by showing all the data and see what we will get.</p>
<p>First, with the help of NebulaGraph Explorer, I simply did drag and drop to draw any type of vertex type (TAG) and any type of edge between vertex types (TAG), here we know that all the vertices are connected with others, so no isolated vertices will be missed by this query pattern:</p>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/query-builder-0.webp" title="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/query-builder-0.webp" data-thumbnail="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/query-builder-0.webp">
        
    </a></p>
<p>Let it generate the query statement for me. Here, it defaults to <code>LIMIT 100</code>, so let&rsquo;s change it to something larger (LIMIT 10000) and let it execute in the Console.</p>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/query-builder-1.webp" title="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/query-builder-1.webp" data-thumbnail="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/query-builder-1.webp">
        
    </a></p>
<h4 id="initial-observation" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#initial-observation" class="header-mark"></a>3.3.2 Initial observation</h4><p>The result renders out like this, and you can see that it naturally forms a pattern of clusters.</p>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/bird_view.webp" title="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/bird_view.webp" data-thumbnail="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/bird_view.webp">
        
    </a></p>
<p>These peripheral clusters are mostly made up of players from clubs that are not traditionally strong ones (now we learned that they could win, though, who knows!), and many of those clubs have only one or two players and yet concentrated in one national team or region, so they are kind of isolated from other clusters.</p>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/edge_teams.webp" title="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/edge_teams.webp" data-thumbnail="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/edge_teams.webp">
        
    </a></p>
<h4 id="graph-algorithm-based-analysis" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#graph-algorithm-based-analysis" class="header-mark"></a>3.3.3 Graph algorithm based analysis</h4><p>After I clicked on the two buttons(Sized by Degrees, Colored by Louvain Algorithm) in Explorer (refer to the <a href="https://docs.nebula-graph.com.cn/3.3.0/nebula-explorer/graph-explorer/graph-algorithm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">document</a> for details), in the browser, we can see that the entire graph has become something like this:</p>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/Barcelona.webp" title="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/Barcelona.webp" data-thumbnail="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/Barcelona.webp">
        
    </a></p>
<p>Here, two graph algorithms are utilized to analyze the insights here.</p>
<ol>
<li>change the display size of vertices to highlight importance using their degrees</li>
<li>using Louvain&rsquo;s algorithm to distinguish the community of the vertices</li>
</ol>
<p>You can see that the big red circle is the famous Barcelona, and its players are marked in red, too.</p>
<h3 id="winner-prediction-algorithm" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#winner-prediction-algorithm" class="header-mark"></a>3.4 Winner Prediction Algorithm</h3><p>In order to be able to make full use of the graph magic(with the implied conditions, and information on the graph), my idea(<a href="https://cambridge-intelligence.com/fifa-world-cup-2022-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stolen/inspired from this post</a>) is to choose a graph algorithm that considers edges for node importance analysis, to find out the vertices that have higher importance, iterate and rank them globally, and thus get the top team rankings.</p>
<p>These methods actually reflect the fact that awesome players have greater community, and connectivity at the same time, and at the same time, to increase the differentiation between traditionally strong teams, I am going to take into account the information of appearances and goals scored.</p>
<p>Ultimately, my algorithm is.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take all the <code>(player)-serve-&gt;(club)</code> relationships and filter them for players with too few goals and too few goals per game (to balance out the disproportionate impact of older players from some weaker teams)</li>
<li>Explore outwards from all filtered players to get national teams</li>
<li>Run the Betweenness Centrality algorithm on the above subgraph to calculate the node importance scores</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Betweenness Centrality</a> is an algorithm to measure how a node is important in sense of bridging other nodes in the graph.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="process-of-the-prediction" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#process-of-the-prediction" class="header-mark"></a>3.5 Process of the Prediction</h3><p>首先，我们取出所有进球数超过 10，场均进球超过 0.2 的 (球员)-服役-&gt;(俱乐部) 的子图：</p>
<p>First, we take out the subgraph in the pattern of <code>(player)-serve-&gt;(club)</code> for those who have scored more than 10 goals and have an average of more than 0.2 goals per game.</p>

</div>
</div><blockquote>
<p>Note: For convenience, I have included the number of goals and caps as properties in the serve edge, too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/query_step0.webp" title="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/query_step0.webp" data-thumbnail="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/query_step0.webp">
        
    </a></p>
<p>Then, we select all the vertices on the graph, in the left toolbar, select the <code>belongto</code> edge of the outgoing direction, expand the graph outwards (traverse), and select the icon that marks the newly expanded vertices as flags.</p>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/treversal_step1.webp" title="treversal_step1" data-thumbnail="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/treversal_step1.webp">
        
    </a></p>
<p>Now that we have the final subgraph, we use the graph algorithm function within the browser to execute BNC (Betweenness Centrality):</p>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/bnc_step2.webp" title="bnc_step2" data-thumbnail="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/bnc_step2.webp">
        
    </a></p>
<p>The graph canvas then looks like this:</p>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/bnc_predict.webp" title="bnc_predict" data-thumbnail="/en/chatgpt-and-nebulagraph-predict-fifa-world-cup/bnc_predict.webp">
        
    </a></p>
<h2 id="result" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#result" class="header-mark"></a>4 Result</h2><p>In the end, we sorted according to the value of Betweenness Centrality to get the final winning team: Brazil! 🇧🇷, followed by Belgium, Germany, England, France, and Argentina, so let&rsquo;s wait two weeks to come back and see if the prediction is accurate :D.</p>

<h2 id="task" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#task" class="header-mark"></a>1 Task</h2><p>Imagine we are building a Knowledge Graph for a content provider web service with NebulaGraph, thus leveraging it to support a Knowledge Base QA system, Recommendation System, and Reasoning system.</p>
<p>The knowledge information persisted in different data sources from some Service APIs, Databases, Data Warehouses, or even some files in S3.</p>
<p>We need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyze data to extract needed knowledge</li>
<li>Model the Graph based on relationships we care</li>
<li>Extract the relationships and ingest them to NebulaGraph</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="data-analysis" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#data-analysis" class="header-mark"></a>2 Data Analysis</h2><p>Assume that we are fetching data from <a href="https://www.omdb.org/en/us/content/Help:DataDownload" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OMDB</a> and <a href="https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MovieLens</a>.</p>
<p>OMDB is an open movie database, we now think of it as one of our services, and we can get the following information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Movies</li>
<li>Classification of movies</li>
<li>The crew in the movie (director, action director, actors, post-production, etc.)</li>
<li>Movie covers, promos, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>MovieLens is an open dataset, we consider it as the user data of our services, the information we can obtain is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users</li>
<li>Movies</li>
<li>User interaction on movie ratings</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="graph-modeling" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#graph-modeling" class="header-mark"></a>3 Graph Modeling</h2><p>We were building this Graph for a recommendation system and talked about some basic methods in <a href="siwei.io/recommendation-system-with-graphdb/" rel="">this</a> article, which:</p>
<p>In the Content-Base Filter method(CBF), the relationship of user-&gt; movie, movie-&gt; category, movie-&gt; actor, and movie-&gt; director are concerned.</p>
<p>And the collaborative filtering approach is concerned with the relationship between the user and -&gt; movie.</p>
<p>The recommendation reasoning service is concerned with all the above relationships.</p>
<p>To summarize, we need the following edges:</p>
<ul>
<li>watched(rate(double))</li>
<li>with_genre</li>
<li>directed_by</li>
<li>acted_by</li>
</ul>
<p>Accordingly, the vertex types will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>user(user_id)</li>
<li>movie(name)</li>
<li>person(name, birthdate)</li>
<li>genre(name)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-transform" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#data-transform" class="header-mark"></a>4 Data Transform</h2><p>With the source date finalized, let&rsquo;s see how they could be mapped and transformed into the graph.</p>
<h3 id="from-omdb" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#from-omdb" class="header-mark"></a>4.1 From OMDB</h3><p>First, there is the data in OMDB, which consists of many tables, such as the table <code>all_movies</code>, which stores all the movies and their names in different languages.</p>
<table>
<thead>

<th>movie_id</th>
<th>name</th>
<th>language_iso_639_1</th>

<p>And the <code>all_casts</code> table holds all roles in the film industry.</p>
<table>
<thead>

</table>
<p>But the name and other information of each person here, as well as the position he/she holds in the film, are in separate tables.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>job_names</code></p>
<p>For example, 1 stands for writer, and 2 stands for producer. Interestingly, like movie id and name, job_id to name is a one-to-many relationship, because the data in OMDB is multilingual.</p>

<p>This is a typical case in RDBMS where the data source is a table structure, so for the relationship <code>movie &lt;-[directed_by]-(person)</code>, it involves four tables <code>all_movies</code>, <code>all_casts</code>, <code>all_people</code>, <code>job_names</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>directed_by
<ul>
<li>Starting from person_id in all_casts</li>
<li>To movie_id in all_casts
<ul>
<li>Where job_id is &ldquo;director&rdquo; in job_names</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>movie
<ul>
<li>person_id in all_casts</li>
<li>Name from all_movies by id, language is &ldquo;en&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>person
<ul>
<li>movie_id in all_casts</li>
<li>Name, birthday in all_people</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Till now, all tables we cared about in OMDB are:</p>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="/en/nebulagraph-etl-dbt/modeling_omdb.webp" title="modeling_omdb" data-thumbnail="/en/nebulagraph-etl-dbt/modeling_omdb.webp">
        
    </a></p>
<h3 id="from-movielens-dataset" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#from-movielens-dataset" class="header-mark"></a>4.2 From MovieLens dataset</h3><p>While the above is just about one data source, in real scenarios, we also need to collect and aggregate data from other sources. For example, now also need to extract knowledge from the MovieLens dataset.</p>
<p>Here, the only relationship we utilize is <code>user -&gt; movie</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>movies.csv</code></li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>movieId</th>
<th>title</th>
<th>genres</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Toy Story (1995)</td>
<td>Adventure</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Jumanji (1995)</td>
<td>Adventure</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Grumpier Old Men (1995)</td>
<td>Comedy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Waiting to Exhale (1995)</td>
<td>Comedy</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<ul>
<li><code>ratings.csv</code></li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>userId</th>
<th>movieId</th>
<th>rating</th>
<th>timestamp</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>964982703</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>964981247</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>6</td>

<td>964982224</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>From the preview of the data in the two tables, naturally, we need one type of relationship: <code>watched</code> and vertex: <code>user</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>watched
<ul>
<li>Starting from the userId in <code>ratings.csv</code></li>
<li>To movieId in <code>ratings.csv</code></li>
<li>With rating from rating in <code>ratings.csv</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>user
<ul>
<li>With userId from <code>ratings.csv</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, you must have noticed that movieId in the MovieLens dataset and movie id in OMDB are two different systems, if we need to associate them, we need to convert movieId in MovieLens to movie id in OMDB, and the condition of association between them is a movie title.</p>
<p>However, by observation, we know that:</p>
<ol>
<li>the titles in OMDB movies are multilingual</li>
<li>the titles in MovieLens have the year information like <code>(1995)</code> at the end of the title</li>
</ol>
<p>So our conclusion is</p>
<ul>
<li>watched
<ul>
<li>Starting from the userId in <code>ratings.csv</code></li>
<li>To movieId in <code>ratings.csv</code>
<ul>
<li>Get the movie title with movieId from <code>movies.csv</code> and find its movie_id from OMDB
<ul>
<li>Where we should match the title in language: English with the suffix of the year being removed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With rating from rating in <code>ratings.csv</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>user
<ul>
<li>With userId from <code>ratings.csv</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the modeling puts the two tables like this figure:</p>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="/en/nebulagraph-etl-dbt/modeling_omdb_movielens.webp" title="modeling_omdb_movielens" data-thumbnail="/en/nebulagraph-etl-dbt/modeling_omdb_movielens.webp">
        
    </a></p>
<h3 id="graph-modeling-property-graph" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#graph-modeling-property-graph" class="header-mark"></a>4.3 Graph Modeling (Property Graph)</h3><p>To summarize, we need to aggregate different tables (or CSV files in table form) from multiple data sources, such that the correspondence is shown in the figure: where the blue dashed line indicates the source of data information for the vertices in the graph, and the pink dashed line indicates the source of edge information.</p>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="/en/nebulagraph-etl-dbt/schema_mapping_to_graph.webp" title="schema_mapping_to_graph" data-thumbnail="/en/nebulagraph-etl-dbt/schema_mapping_to_graph.webp">
        
    </a></p>
<p>Then, we have to format the ids of individuals in different tables, for example, user_id, which is a self-incrementing number that we want to convert to a globally unique vertex_id. A convenient way to do this is to add a string prefix to the existing id, such as <code>u_</code>.</p>
<p>Eventually, for the relationship <code>user -[watched]-&gt; movie</code>, we can process the table structure data as follows.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>user_id</th>
<th>rating</th>
<th>title</th>
<th>omdb_movie_id</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>u_1</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>Seven (a.k.a. Se7en)</td>
<td>807</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>u_1</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope</td>
<td>11</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>u_1</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>u_1</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>Mask, The</td>
<td>832</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>u_1</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>Mrs. Doubtfire</td>
<td>832</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Where, in each row, three variables exist to construct the graph structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>user</code> vertex id</li>
<li><code>movie</code> vertex id</li>
<li>the rating value as the property of the <code>watched</code> edge</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tooling" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#tooling" class="header-mark"></a>5 Tooling</h2><p>At this point, we have completed the data analysis and graph modeling design, before we start the &ldquo;extract correlations, import graph database&rdquo;, let&rsquo;s introduce the tools we will use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Extracting relationships&rdquo; can be simply considered as Extract and Transform in ETL, which is essentially the engineering of data mapping and transformation, and there are many different tools and open-source projects available on the market. Here we use one of my personal favorite tools: dbt.</p>
<h3 id="dbt" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#dbt" class="header-mark"></a>5.1 dbt</h3><p>dbt is an open-source data conversion tool with a very mature community and ecology, which can perform efficient, controlled, and high-quality data conversion work in most of the mainstream data warehouses, whether it is for ad-hoc tasks or complex orchestration, dbt can be very competent.</p>
<p>One of the features of dbt is that it uses a SQL-like language to describe the rules of data transformation. With GitOps, it is very elegant to collaborate and maintain complex data processing operations in large data teams. And the built-in data testing capabilities allow you to control the quality of your data and make it reproducible and controllable.</p>
<p>dbt not only has many integrated subprojects but also can be combined with many other excellent open source projects (meltano, AirFlow, Amundsen, Superset, etc.) to form a set of modern data infrastructure systems, feel free to check my previous article: data lineage and metadata governance reference architecture <a href="https://siwei.io/en/data-lineage-oss-ref-solution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://siwei.io/en/data-lineage-oss-ref-solution</a>, where the whole solution looks like:</p>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1651790/168849779-4826f50e-ff87-4e78-b17f-076f91182c43.svg" title="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1651790/168849779-4826f50e-ff87-4e78-b17f-076f91182c43.svg" data-thumbnail="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1651790/168849779-4826f50e-ff87-4e78-b17f-076f91182c43.svg">
        
    </a></p>
<p>In short, dbt is a command line tool written in python, and we can create a project folder, which contains a YAML formatted configuration file, to specify where the source information for the data transformation is and where the target is (where the processed data is stored, maybe Postgres, Big Query, Spark, etc.). In the data source, we use the YAML file along with the <code>.SQL</code> file to describe the information about &ldquo;what data to fetch from, how to do the transformation, and what to output&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="/en/nebulagraph-etl-dbt/starter-project-dbt-cli.webp" title="starter-project-dbt-cli" data-thumbnail="/en/nebulagraph-etl-dbt/starter-project-dbt-cli.webp">
        
    </a></p>
<p>You can see that the information in the models/example is the core data transformation rules, and all the other data is metadata related to this transformation. DataOps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>You can refer to the dbt documentation to get a hands-on understanding of it: <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/get-started/getting-started-dbt-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/get-started/getting-started-dbt-core</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="nebulagraph-data-ingestion" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#nebulagraph-data-ingestion" class="header-mark"></a>5.2 NebulaGraph data ingestion</h3><p>After processing the data by dbt, we can get intermediate data that maps directly to different types of vertices, edges, and table structures of their attributes, either in the form of CSV files, tables in DWs, or even data frames in Spark, and there are different options for importing them into NebulaGraph, of which NebulaGraph Exchange, Nebula-Importer, and Nebula-Spark-Connector can be used to import the data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the different tools for NebulaGraph data import at <a href="https://siwei.io/en/sketches/nebula-data-import-options" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://siwei.io/en/sketches/nebula-data-import-options</a> to know how to choose one of them c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, I will use the simplest one, Nebula-Importer, as an example.</p>
<p>Nebula-Importer is an open-source tool written in Golang that compiles into a single file binary, it gets the correspondence of vertices and edges from a given CSV file to a NebulaGraph for reading and importing via a preconfigured YAML format file.</p>

<h2 id="dbt--nebula-importer-in-actions" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#dbt--nebula-importer-in-actions" class="header-mark"></a>6 dbt + Nebula-Importer in Actions</h2><p>Now let&rsquo;s use dbt + Nebula-Importer to end-to-end demonstrate how to extract, transform and import multiple data sources into NebulaGraph, the whole project code has been open-sourced, the repository is at <a href="https://github.com/wey-gu/movie-recommendation-dataset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/wey-gu/movie-recommendation-dataset</a>, feel free to check for details there.</p>
<p>The whole process is as follows.</p>

    <a href="#summary" class="header-mark"></a>7 Summary</h2><p>When we plan to leverage graph databases for massive data to transform knowledge and analyze insights, the first step is often to transform, process, and model multiple data sources into graph data. For beginners who have no idea where to start, a feasible idea is to start from all relevant information, picture the most concerning relationship, and then list the vertices that can be obtained and the required properties attached. After determining the initial modeling, you can use the ETL tool to clean the original data, ETL into table structure which will be mapped to the graph, and finally, use the import tool to import NebulaGraph for further model iterations.</p>
<p>With the help of dbt, we can version control, test, iterate our modeling and data transformation, and gradually evolve and enrich the constructed knowledge graph with grace.</p>

    <a href="#graph-modeling" class="header-mark"></a>1.1 Graph Modeling</h3><p>We started the modeling with the existing historical data, annotated information oriented to the relationship of the property graph. The data source could be the transaction event records, user data, and risk control annotations in the banking, e-commerce, or insurance industries in multiple table structures.</p>
<p>The modeling process is to abstract the entities we care about, the relationships between them, and the meaningful properties attached to both entities and relationships.</p>
<p>In general, persons, corporate entities, phone numbers, addresses, devices (e.g., terminal devices, network addresses, WiFi SSIDs to which terminal devices are connected, etc.), and orders are entities we started with to consider, and other information such as is_risky label, and information about persons and corporate entities (occupation, income, education, etc.) are modeled as properties of entities.</p>
<p>The model looks like this and the corresponding dataset could be generated with <a href="https://github.com/wey-gu/fraud-detection-datagen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fraud-detection-datagen</a>, with which you could generate dataset in any expected scale and community sturcture.</p>

有了一张囊括了人、公司、历史贷款申请记录、电话、线上申请网络设备的图谱，我们可以挖掘一些有意思的信息。

-->
<p>With a graph that encompasses persons, companies, historical loan application records, phone calls, and online applications for web-based devices, we can uncover some interesting information with certain graph queries directly.</p>
<!--

事实上，很多值得被发现、并有效阻止从而止损的骗保行为是具有群体聚集性的。比如欺诈团伙可能是一小批人（比如3到5人）有组织地收集更大规模的身份证信息（比如30张），同时发起多个金融机构大量贷款，然后在放款后选择丢弃这批留下了违约记录的身份证，再进一步选择下一批身份证信息如法炮制。

-->
<p>In fact, many frauds are clusterred in nature. For example, a fraud ring may be a small group of people (e.g., 3 to 5 people) who collect ID information on a larger scale (e.g., 30) in an organized manner, initiate a large number of loans from multiple financial institutions at the same time, and then choose to discard the batch of IDs that have left a record of default after they have been disbursed, and then further choose the next batch of ID information as they have done.</p>
<!--

这种团伙作案的方式因为利用了大量新的身份信息，完全利用历史记录去黑名单规避风险的方式是无效的。不过，借助于关联关系的视角，这些模式是一定程度上可以被及时识别出来的。

-->
<p>Due to the group of frauds keeps utilizing new identity information, it&rsquo;s hard to detect with historical records based blacklist mechanism. However, with the help of the patterns being queried in graph, such case could be resovled in real-time.</p>
<!--

这些模式可以被识别出的规律我把它分成两种：

-->
<p>These patterns can be categorised into two types:</p>
<!--

一种是风控专家可以直接用某种模式来描述的，例如：和已经被标注为高风险的实体有直接或者间接的关联关系（新订单申请人使用了和过往高风险记录相同的网络设备），这种模式对应到图谱中，通过一个图查询就可以实时给出结果。

另一种是隐含在数据的关联关系背后，需要通过图算法挖掘得出的一些风险提示，例如：尽管给定的实体与有限的标注高风险实体没有匹配的关联，但是它在图中形成了聚集性可能提示我们这可能是一个尚未得手的进行中的团伙贷款诈骗的其中一次申请，这种情况可以通过定期在历史数据中批量执行社区发现算法得出，并在高聚集社区中利用中心性算法给出核心实体，一并提示给风险专家进行后续评估和风险标注。

-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>One is that which can be directly described by the risk control expert in terms of some pattern, e.g., a direct or indirect association with an entity that has been marked as high risk (new order applicants use the same network devices as past high risk records), and this pattern corresponds to the graph, which gives results in real time through a graph query.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another type of association is implicitly behind the correlation of the data, which needs to be mined by graph algorithms for some risk hints, e.g., although a given entity has no matching association with a limited number of labeled high-risk entities, the aggregation it forms in the graph may suggest that this may be one of the applications of an ongoing gang loan fraud that has not yet succeeded, which can be derived by periodically batching in the historical data This situation can be derived by periodically performing community discovery algorithms in bulk in historical data, and using centrality algorithms in highly aggregated communities to give core entities that are prompted to risk experts for subsequent evaluation and risk labeling.</p>

<p>The answer is yes.</p>
<h3 id="expand-labels-in-graph" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#expand-labels-in-graph" class="header-mark"></a>1.3 Expand labels in Graph</h3><!--

Xiaojin Z. 和 Zoubin G. 在论文：[Learning from Labeled and Unlabeled Data with Label Propagation](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/papers/CMU-CALD-02-107.pdf) （CMU-CALD-02-107）中，利用标签传播（Label Propagation）算法来把有限的标注信息在图上通过关联关系传播到更多实体中。

<p>In the paper: <a href="http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/papers/CMU-CALD-02-107.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learning from Labeled and Unlabeled Data with Label Propagation</a> (CMU-CALD-02-107) by Xiaojin Z. and Zoubin G., the Label Propagation algorithm is used to propagate limited labeled information on the graph to more entities through the edges.</p>
<p>In this way, we can easily &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; more labeled information with a limited number of high-risk annotations in the graphs we build. These extended labeles can, on the one hand, give more results in real-time graph queries and, on the other hand, serve as important input for risk control experts to help advance anti-fraud investigation actions.</p>
<p>In general, we can scan the graph data offline periodically, expand and update the labels by the graph algorithm, and then write the valid updated labels back to the graph.</p>

<p>Note that there is a similar method, SIGNDiffusion, for those who are interested.</p>

在风控领域开始利用图的思想和能力之前，已经有很多利用机器学习的分类算法基于历史数据预测高风险行为的方法了，这些方法把记录中领域专家认为有关的信息（例如：年龄、学历、收入）作为特征，历史标注信息作为标签去训练风险预测模型。

那么读到的这里，我们是否会想到在这些方法的基础之上，如果把基于图结构的属性也考虑进来，作为特征去训练的模型可能更有效呢？答案也是肯定的，已经有很多论文和工程实践揭示这样的模型比未考虑图特征的算法更加有效：这些被尝试有效的图结构特征可能是实体的 PageRank 值、Degree 值或者是某一个社区发现算法得出的社区 id。

在生产上，我们可以定期从图谱中获得实时的全图信息，在图计算平台中分析运算获得所需特征，经过预定的数据管道，导入机器学习模型中周期获得新的风险提示，并将部分结果写回图谱方便其他系统和专家抽取、参考。

-->
<p>Before the field of risk control started to leverage the methods of the graph, there have been many approaches to predict high-risk behavior based on historical data using machine learning classification algorithms that use information in records that domain experts consider relevant (e.g., age, education, income) as features and historical label information to train risk prediction models.</p>
<p>So reading this, does it occur to us that on top of these methods, models trained as features might be more effective if attributes based on graph structure were also taken into account?</p>
<p>The answer is also yes, and there have been many papers and engineering practices revealing that such models are more effective than algorithms that do not consider graph features: these graph structure features that are tried to be effective could be PageRank values of entities, Degree values, or community ids derived from one of the community discovery algorithms.</p>
<p>In production, we can periodically obtain real-time full graph information from the graph, analyze it in a graph computing platform to obtain the required features, go through a predefined data pipeline, import it into a machine learning model cycle to obtain new risk cues, and write some of the results back to the graph for easy extraction and reference by other systems and experts.</p>
<h4 id="example-of-ml-with-graph-features" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#example-of-ml-with-graph-features" class="header-mark"></a>1.4.1 Example of ML with Graph Features</h4><!--

这里，端到端机器学习的方法我就不演示了，就是常见的分类方法，在此之上，我们可以在数据中通过图算法获得一些新的属性，这些属性再处理一下作为新的特征。我只演示一个社区发现的方法，我们可以对全图跑一个 Louvain，得出不同节点的社区归属，然后把社区的值当做一个分类处理成为数值的特征。

这个例子里我们还用 https://github.com/wey-gu/fraud-detection-datagen 这个数据，在此基础上，这个例子我用到了 [Nebula-Algorithm](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-algorithm/) 这个项目，它是一个 Spark 应用，可以在 NebulaGraph 图库上运行很多常用的图算法。

-->
<p>Here, I will not demonstrate the end-to-end machine learning example, which is a common classification approach, on top of which we can get some new properties in the data by graph algorithms, which are then processed as new features. I will only demonstrate a community discovery method where we can run a Louvain on the full graph, derive the community identity of different nodes, and then process the community values as a classification into numerical features.</p>
<p>In this example we also use the data from <a href="https://github.com/wey-gu/fraud-detection-datagen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/wey-gu/fraud-detection-datagen</a>, on top of which I used <a href="https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NebulaGraph-Algorithm</a> project, a Spark application that runs many common graph algorithms on the NebulaGraph graph database.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s set up a NebulaGraph cluster with Spark and NebulaGraph Algorithm, in one-liner thanks to Nebula-UP</p>

然而，前边这些基于图特征的方法的问题在于：

1. 图特征并不能把关联关系，数据的局部性充分反映到我们的模型、方法里；
2. 图的特征工程是很昂贵、繁琐的。

在最近几年的成果中，基于 GNN 的方法通过将图结构与属性信息进行嵌入表示，使得我们能在不进行图特征抽取、特征工程、专家与工程方法的数据标注的情况下，得到相比于基于传统图特征的机器学习更好的效果。有意思的是，现在正是这些方法快速被发现、演进的时期，基于图的深度学习是之前几年最热门的机器学习研究方向之一。

同时，图深度学习的一些方法可以做到 Inductive Learning——模型可以在新的点、边上进行推理，这样，配合图数据库上线上的子图查询能力，在线实时的风险预测也变得很简单可行了。

-->
<p>However, the problem with these previous graph feature-based approaches is that</p>
<ol>
<li>graph features do not fully reflect the correlations and the locality nature of the data, into our models/ methods.</li>
<li>graph feature engineering could be expensive and cumbersome.</li>
</ol>
<p>In recent years, GNN-based approaches have enabled us to get better results than traditional graph feature-based machine learning by embedding graph structure and attribute information into the representation without graph feature extraction, feature engineering, and data annotation by experts and engineering methods. Interestingly, this is the period when these methods are rapidly being discovered and evolving, and graph-based deep learning is one of the hottest machine learning research directions in the previous years.</p>
<p>At the same time, some methods of graph deep learning can do Inductive Learning - models can inference/reason on new points and edges, so that, together with the ability to query subgraphs on the graph database online, online real-time risk prediction becomes simple and feasible.</p>

利用 GNN 的方法中，图数据库并不是必须的，数据的存储可以在其他几种常见的介质之中，但是图库能够最大化助益模型训练、模型更新、线上结果的更新。当我们把图数据库作为数据的单一数据来源（single source of truth）的时候，所有的基于线上、离线、图谱的方法可以很容易被集成起来，从而组合所有方法的优势与结果，做出更有效的欺诈检测复合系统。

在这个示例中我们一样分为：**数据处理**、**模型训练**、**构建检测系统**这几部分。

<p>The storage of data can be in several other common media, but the graph database can maximize the benefit of model training, model updating, and online results updating. When we use the graph database as the single source of truth for the data, all online, offline, and graph-based approaches can be easily integrated to combine the advantages and results of all approaches to make a more effective composite system for fraud detection.</p>
<p>In this example we are divided into the same parts: <strong>Data processing</strong>, <strong>Model training</strong>, <strong>Building an online detection system</strong>.</p>

这部分的任务是将图谱中和风险相关子图的拓扑结构表示和其中有关的特征（属性）进行工程处理，序列化成为 DGL 的图对象。

DGL 本身支持从点、边列表（edgelist）形式 CSV 文件，或者从 NetworkX 和 SciPy 的序列化稀疏的邻接矩阵（adjacency matrix）的数据来构造它的图对象，我们可以把原始的图数据或者图库中的数据全量导出为这些形式，不过在真实的例子中图库中的数据是实时变化的，能够直接在 NebulaGraph 中的子图上做 GNN 训练一般来说是更理想。得益于 Nebula-DGL 这个库，做这件事儿是很自然的。

> 注，DGL 外部数据员导入文档：https://docs.dgl.ai/guide/graph-external.html

现在我们开始这个数据的导入，在这之前，我先介绍一下 Nebula-DGL。

Nebula-DGL 可以根据给定的映射和转换规则（YAML 格式），将 NebulaGraph 中的顶点、边，和它们的属性按照规则处理成为点、边、和其中的标注（Label）与特征（Feature），从而构造为 DGL 的图对象。这其中，值得一提的是属性到特征的转换。我们知道，特征可能是某一个属性的值、一个或者多个属性的值做一定的数学变换、亦或是字符型的属性按照枚举规则输出为数字。相应的，Nebula-DGL 在规则中，我们都可以针对这几种情况利用 `filter` 进行表达：

- 特征直接选取属性的值：

-->
<p>The task of this part is to engineer the topological representation of the risk-related subgraphs of the graph and the related features (attributes) in them, and serialize them into graph objects of the DGL.</p>
<p>DGL itself supports constructing its graph objects from CSV files in the form of point and edge lists (edgelist), or from data in the serialized sparse adjacency matrix of NetworkX and SciPy, and we can export the raw graph data or the full amount of data in the graph library to these forms. However, in the real case the data in the library is changing in real time and it is generally better to do GNN training directly on the subgraphs in NebulaGraph. Thanks to the Nebula-DGL library, this is a natural thing to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note, the DGL external datamaster import documentation: <a href="https://docs.dgl.ai/guide/graph-external.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.dgl.ai/guide/graph-external.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s start this data import, before that I&rsquo;ll introduce Nebula-DGL.</p>
<p>Nebula-DGL can construct graph objects as DGL by processing vertices, edges, and their properties in NebulaGraph into vertecies, edges, and their labels and features according to the given mapping and transformation rules (YAML format). Among them, it is worth mentioning the property-to-feature conversion.</p>
<p>As we know, a feature can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>The value of a property</li>
<li>The value of one or more properties with certain mathematical transformations</li>
<li>The output of a character property as a number according to enumeration rules</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, they can be expressed in the Nebula-DGL API using <code>filter</code> for each of these cases, and let&rsquo;s see how this could be done in examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Featre extracted directly from value of vertex/edge property</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, the edge type <code>follow</code> will be extracted, where the property <code>degree</code>&rsquo;s value will be treated as a feature directly, and its expression in Nebula-DGL is:</p>

<p>With this transforming API being undsood, let&rsquo;s started to process the Yelp dataset:</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s define this transforming rule, where, we transform TAG: review and all three EDGE Types, with their properties values directly transforming into features:</p>

这里，我用 [GraphSAGE](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/graphsage-nips17.pdf) 算法的点分类（Node Classification）方法来举例，GraphSAGE 的原始版本是一个归纳学习（Inductive Learning）的算法，这里，归纳学习区别于它的反面： Transductive Learning ，可以把新的数据用在完全旧的图之上习得的模型，这样训练出来的模型可以进行线上增量数据的欺诈检测（而不是需要重新加载为全图训练才可以）。

-->
<p>Here, I use the Node Classification method of the <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/graphsage-nips17.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphSAGE</a> algorithm as an example, the original version of GraphSAGE is an Inductive Learning algorithm.</p>
<p>An Inductive Learning algorithm, which is distinguished from its opposite: Transductive Learning, means that new data can be used on top of a completely old graph to acquire a model so that the trained model can be used for online incremental data fraud detection (instead of needing to be reloaded to the full graph for training).</p>

<p><strong>Dataset split</strong></p>
<!--

机器学习训练的过程需要在已经有的数据、信息中分割出用来训练、验证和测试的子集，他们可以是不相交的整体数据的真子集也可以彼此有重叠，在实际的情况中，有时候我们对数据的标注常常是不充分的，所以按照标注的比例去分割数据可能更有意义一些，下边的例子是我按照点上是否标注欺诈为标准去分割数据集。

这里边有两个地方值得注意：

1. `train_test_split` 中的 `stratify=g.ndata['is_fraud']` 代表保持 `is_fraud` 的值的分布去分割，符合我们前边提到的思想。
2. 我们分割的是 `idx` 索引，这样，可以最终获得三个集合的索引，供训练、验证和测试时候使用。同时我们还把对应集合 mask 放到图对象 `g` 里边去了。

-->
<p>The process of machine learning training requires partitioning the already available data, information for training, validation and testing subsets, they can be either disjoint true subsets of the overall data or overlap each other.</p>
<p>In practice, sometimes our labeling of data is often inadequate, so it may make more sense to partition the data according to the proportion of labeling, the following example I segmented the dataset according to whether the vertices are labeled with fraud or not.</p>
<p>There are two points worth noting here.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>stratify=g.ndata['is_fraud']</code> in <code>train_test_split</code> represents to keep the distribution of the values of <code>is_fraud</code> to split, which is in line with the idea we mentioned above.</li>
<li>we split the <code>idx</code> index, so that we can end up with three sets of indexes for training, validation and testing. At the same time, we also put the corresponding set of masks into the graph object <code>g</code>.</li>

<!--

GraphSAGE 是针对同构图，且边无 feature 的算法，而我们当下的 Yelp 图谱是异构的：一类点、三类边。那么，如何才能用 GraphSAGE 去建模 Yelp 图谱呢？

我们除了选择用针对异构图的 Inductive Learning 方法之外，还可想办法把同构图转换成异构图。为了在转换中不丢失重要的边类型信息，我们可以把边类型变成数值。

这里我给了一维的 edge feature，当然（3-1）二维也是可以的。

-->
<p>GraphSAGE is an algorithm for Homogeneous graphs with no feature on edges, while our current Yelp graph is Heterogeneous: one type of vertex(TAG) and three types of edges. So, how can we use GraphSAGE to model Yelp graphs?</p>
<p>Instead of finding another Inductive Learning to supports heterogeneous graphs, I actually find a way to convert homogeneous graph into a heterogeneous one. In order not to lose important edge type information in the conversion, we can make the edge type numeric.</p>
<p>Here I have given a one-dimensional edge feature, but of course (3-1) two-dimensional is also possible.</p>

    <a href="#inference-api" class="header-mark"></a>1.5.1.4 Inference API</h5><p>As mentioned earlier, GraphSAGE is the simplest model to support Inductive Learning, thus our training inference process above is actually not yet the same as our test and training graphs, although the indexes of the training points are labeled, the whole graph is actually used as input.</p>
<p>In order to do Inductive Learning we just need to divide the training and testing into two non-intersecting subgraphs for training and final testing.</p>

</div><p>As you can see, in our code above, the graph used for testing and the graph used for training are two completely different sets of data, which allows our online system to be data that we haven&rsquo;t encountered before at all.</p>
<p>Thus, we can simply write the data for a new incoming transaction request into NebulaGraph and then get a small subgraph that the online system can return from that point, and use it as input to the model inference to get the labels of the subgraph!</p>
<p><strong>A new trasnaction request</strong>：</p>

    <a href="#conclusion" class="header-mark"></a>1.6 Conclusion</h3><!--

总结起来，欺诈检测的方法有：

- 在一个交易历史、风控的图谱上，通过图模式查询直接获得风险提示
- 定期利用图算法扩充风险标注，写回图库
- 定期计算图谱中的图特征，和其他特征一起用传统机器学习方法离线预测风险
- 将图谱中的属性处理成为点、边特征，用图神经网络方法离线预测风险，部分可以 Inductive Learning 的方法结合图库可以实现在线风险预测

-->
<p>To summarize, fraud detection with NebulaGraph Graph Database could be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>With graph queries to get risk metrics from graph database</li>
<li>With risky label being expanded by graph algorithms and written back to graph database</li>
<li>With ML methods including graph features being fetched from graph database</li>
<li>Process the property in the graph into the node and edge features to predict risk offline using GNN methods, some of which can be combined with the graph database to achieve online risk prediction by Inductive Learning methods</li>
</ul>

<p>Do I have to create my own graph model and everything to set up a Data Lineage system? Thanks to many great open-source projects, the answer is: No!</p>
<p>Today, I would like to share my opinionated reference data infra stack with some of those best open-source projects with modern ETL, Dashboard, Metadata Governance, and Data Lineage Management.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="metadata-governance-system" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#metadata-governance-system" class="header-mark"></a>1 Metadata Governance system</h2><p>A Metadata Governance system is a system providing a single view of where and how all the data are formatted, generated, transformed, consumed, presented, and owned.</p>
<p>Metadata Governance is like a catalog of all of the data warehouses, databases, tables, dashboards, ETL jobs, etc so that people don&rsquo;t have to broadcast their queries on &ldquo;Hi everyone, could I change the schema of this table?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hey, anyone who knows how I could find the raw data of table-view-foo-bar?&rdquo;, which, explains why we need a Metadata Governance system in a mature data stack with a relatively large scale of data and team(or one to be grown to).</p>
<p>For the other term, Data Lineage, is one of the Metadata that needs to be managed, for example, some dashboard is the downstream of a table view, which has an upstream as two other tables from different databases. That information should be managed at best when possible, too, to enable a trust chain on a data-driven team.</p>
<h2 id="the-reference-solution" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-reference-solution" class="header-mark"></a>2 The reference solution</h2><h3 id="motivation" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#motivation" class="header-mark"></a>2.1 Motivation</h3><p>The metadata and data lineage are by nature fitting to the graph model/graph database well, and the relationship-oriented queries, for instance, &ldquo;finding all n-depth data lineage per given component(i.e. a table)&rdquo; is a <code>FIND ALL PATH</code> query in a graph database.</p>
<p>This also explains one observation of mine as an OSS contributor of Nebula Graph, a distributed graph database: (from their queries/graph modeling in discussions I could tell) a bunch of teams who are already levering Nebula Graph on their tech stack, are setting up a data lineage system on their own, from scratch.</p>
<p>A Metadata Governance system needs some of the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metadata Extractor
<ul>
<li>This part is needed to either pull or be pushed from the different parties of the data stack like databases, data warehouses, dashboards, or even from ETL pipeline and applications, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Metadata Storage
<ul>
<li>This could be either a database or even large JSON manifest files</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Metadata Catalog
<ul>
<li>This could be a system providing API and/or a GUI interface to read/write the metadata and data lineage</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In Nebula Graph community, I had been seeing many graph database users were building their in-house data lineage system. It’s itching witnessing this entropy increase situation not be standarized or jointly contributed instead, as most of their work are parsing metadata from well-known big-data projects, and persistent into a graph database, which, I consider high probability that the work is common.</p>
<p>Then I came to create an opinionated reference data infra stack with some of those best open-source projects put together. Hopefully, those who were gonna define and iterate their own fashion of Graph Model on Nebula Graph and create in-house Metadata and data linage extracting pipelines can benefit from this project to have a relatively polished, beautifully designed, Metadata Governance system out of the box with a fully evolved graph model.</p>
<p>To make the reference project self-contained and runnable, I tried to put layers of data infra stack more than just pure metadata related ones, thus, maybe it will help new data engineers who would like to try and see how far had open-source pushed a modern data lab to.</p>
<p>This is a diagram of all the components in this reference data stack, where I see most of them as Metadata Sources:</p>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1651790/168849779-4826f50e-ff87-4e78-b17f-076f91182c43.svg" title="diagram-of-ref-project" data-thumbnail="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1651790/168849779-4826f50e-ff87-4e78-b17f-076f91182c43.svg">
        
    </a></p>
<h3 id="the-data-stack" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-data-stack" class="header-mark"></a>2.2 The Data Stack</h3><p>Then, let&rsquo;s introduce the components.</p>
<h4 id="database-and-data-warehouse" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#database-and-data-warehouse" class="header-mark"></a>2.2.1 Database and Data Warehouse</h4><p>For processing and consuming raw and intermediate data, one or more databases and/or warehouses should be used.</p>
<p>It could be any DB/DW like Hive, Apache Delta, TiDB, Cassandra, MySQL, or Postgres, in this reference project, we simply choose one of the most popular ones: Postgres. And our reference lab comes with the first service:</p>
<p>✅ - Data warehouse: Postgres</p>
<h4 id="dataops" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#dataops" class="header-mark"></a>2.2.2 DataOps</h4><p>We should have some sort of DataOps setup to enable pipelines and environments to be repeatable, testable, and version-controlled.</p>
<p>Here, we used <a href="https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meltano</a> created by GitLab.</p>
<p>Meltano is a just-work DataOps platform that connected <a href="https://singer.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Singer</a> as the EL and <a href="https://getdbt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dbt</a> as the T in a magically elegant way, it is also connected to some other dataInfra utilities such as Apache Superset and Apache Airflow, etc.</p>
<p>Thus, we have one more thing to be included:</p>
<p>✅ - GitOps: Meltano</p>
<h4 id="etl" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#etl" class="header-mark"></a>2.2.3 ETL</h4><p>And under the hood, we will E(extract) and L(load) data from many different data sources to data targets leveraging <a href="https://singer.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Singer</a> together with Meltano, and do T(transformation) with <a href="https://getdbt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dbt</a>.</p>
<p>✅ - EL: Singer</p>
<p>✅ - T: dbt</p>
<h4 id="data-visualization" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#data-visualization" class="header-mark"></a>2.2.4 Data Visualization</h4><p>How about creating dashboards, charts, and tables for getting the insights into all the data?</p>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1651790/172800854-8e01acae-696d-4e07-8e3e-a7d34dec8278.png" title="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1651790/172800854-8e01acae-696d-4e07-8e3e-a7d34dec8278.png" data-thumbnail="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1651790/172800854-8e01acae-696d-4e07-8e3e-a7d34dec8278.png">
        
    </a></p>
<p><a href="https://superset.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Superset</a> is one of the greatest visualization platforms we could choose from, and we just add it to our packet!</p>
<p>✅ - Dashboard: Apache Superset</p>
<h4 id="job-orchestration" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#job-orchestration" class="header-mark"></a>2.2.5 Job Orchestration</h4><p>In most cases, our DataOps jobs grow to the scale to be executed in a long time that needs to be orchestrated, and here comes the <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Airflow</a>.</p>
<p>✅ - DAG: Apache Airflow</p>
<h4 id="metadata-governance" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#metadata-governance" class="header-mark"></a>2.2.6 Metadata governance</h4><p>With more components and data being introduced to a data infra, there will be massive metadata in all lifecycle of databases, tables, schemas, dashboards, DAGs, applications, and their administrators and teams could be collectively managed, connected, and discovered.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linux Foundation Amundsen</a> is one of the best projects solving this problem.</p>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1651790/172801018-ecd67fa9-2743-451f-8734-b14f2a814199.png" title="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1651790/172801018-ecd67fa9-2743-451f-8734-b14f2a814199.png" data-thumbnail="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1651790/172801018-ecd67fa9-2743-451f-8734-b14f2a814199.png">
        
    </a></p>
<p>✅ - Data Discovery: Linux Foundation Amundsen</p>
<p>With a graph database as the source of truth to accelerate the multi-hop queries together with elasticsearch as the full-text search engine, Amundsen indexes all the metadata and their lineage smoothly, and beautifully in the next level.</p>
<p>By default, <a href="https://neo4j.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">neo4j</a> was used as the graph database, while I will be using <a href="http://nebula-graph.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nebula Graph</a> instead in this project due to I am more familiar with the latter.</p>
<p>✅ - Full-text Search: elasticsearch</p>
<p>✅ - Graph Database: Nebula Graph</p>
<p>Now, with the components in our stack being revealed, let&rsquo;s have them assembled.</p>
<h2 id="environment-bootstrap-component-overview" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#environment-bootstrap-component-overview" class="header-mark"></a>3 Environment Bootstrap, Component overview</h2><p>The reference runnable project is open-source and you could find it here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wey-gu/data-lineage-ref-solution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/wey-gu/data-lineage-ref-solution</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I will try my best to make things clean and isolated. It&rsquo;s assumed you are running on a UNIX-like system with internet and Docker Compose being installed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please refer <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to install Docker and Docker Compose before moving forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am running it on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS X86_64, but there shouldn&rsquo;t be issues on other distros or versions of Linux.</p>
<h3 id="run-a-data-warehouse-database" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#run-a-data-warehouse-database" class="header-mark"></a>3.1 Run a Data Warehouse/ Database</h3><p>First, let&rsquo;s install Postgres as our data warehouse.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s quite cool, ah? For now, we have a simple but typical data stack like any hobby data lab with everything open-source!</p>
<p>Imagine we have 100 datasets in CSV, 200 tables in Data warehouse and a couple of data engineers running different projects that consume, generate different application, dashboard, and databases. When someone would like to discovery some of those table, dataset, dashboard and pipelines running across them, and then even modify some of them, it&rsquo;s proven to be quite costly in both communicationand engineering.</p>
<p>Here comes the main part of our reference project: Metadata Discovery.</p>
<h3 id="metadata-discovery" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#metadata-discovery" class="header-mark"></a>3.4 Metadata Discovery</h3><p>Then, we are stepping to deploy the Amundsen with Nebula Graph and Elasticsearch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: For the time being, the <a href="https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/pull/1817" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PR Nebula Graph as the Amundsen backend</a> is not yet merged, I am <a href="https://github.com/amundsen-io/rfcs/pull/48" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working with the Amundsen team</a> to make it happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With Amundsen, we could have all metadata of the whole data stack being discovered and managed in one place. And there are mainly two parts of Amundsen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metadata Ingestion
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/databuilder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amundsen Data builder</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Metadata Catalog
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/frontend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amundsen Frontend service</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/metadata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amundsen Metadata service</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amundsen Search service</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be leveraging <code>Data builder</code> to pull metadata from different sources, and persist metadata into the backend storage of the <code>Meta service</code> and the backend storage of the <code>Search service</code>, then we could search, discover and manage them from the <code>Frontend service</code> or through the API of the <code>Metadata service</code>.</p>
<h4 id="deploy-amundsen" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#deploy-amundsen" class="header-mark"></a>3.4.1 Deploy Amundsen</h4><h5 id="metadata-service" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#metadata-service" class="header-mark"></a>3.4.1.1 Metadata service</h5><p>We are going to deploy a cluster of Amundsen with its docker-compose file. As the Nebula Graph backend support is not yet merged, we are referring to my fork.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s clone the repo with all submodules:</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">cd</span> amundsen
</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>Then, start all catalog services and their backend storage:</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1

</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><blockquote>
<p>You could add <code>-d</code> to put the containers running in the background:</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1

</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>And this will stop the cluster:</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1

</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>This will remove the cluster:</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1

</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Due to this docker-compose file is for developers to play and hack Amundsen easily rather than for production deployment, it&rsquo;s building images from the codebase, which, will take some time for the very first time.</p>
<p>After it&rsquo;s being deployed, please hold on a second before we load some dummy data into its storage with Data builder.</p>
<h5 id="data-builder" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#data-builder" class="header-mark"></a>3.4.1.2 Data builder</h5><p>Amundsen Data builder is just like a Meltano but for ETL of Metadata to <code>Metadata service</code> and <code>Search service</code>‘s backend storage: Nebula Graph and Elasticsearch.

<p>What could be done with Spark and PySpark on top of Nebula Graph, this post covers everything we should know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this article, I am trying to walk you through all three Spark projects of Nebula Graph with some runnable hands-on examples. Also, I managed to make PySpark usable with Nebula Graph Spark Connector, which will be contributed to the Docs later.</p>
<h2 id="the-three-spark-projects-for-nebula-graph" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-three-spark-projects-for-nebula-graph" class="header-mark"></a>1 The three Spark projects for Nebula Graph</h2><p>I used to draw a sketch around all data importing methods of Nebula Graph <a href="https://www.siwei.io/sketches/nebula-data-import-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, where all three of the Spark-based Nebula Graph projects were already briefly introduced. Instead, in this article, a slightly deeper dive into all of them will be made based on my recent work on them.</p>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<ul>
<li>Nebula Spark Connector is a Spark Lib to enable spark application reading from and writing to Nebula Graph in form of a dataframe.</li>
<li>Nebula Exchange, built on top of Nebula Spark Connector, is a Spark Lib and Application to exchange(for the Open Source version, it&rsquo;s one way: write, whereas for the enterprise version it&rsquo;s bidirectional) different data sources like(MySQL, Neo4j, PostgreSQL, Clickhouse, Hive, etc.). Besides writing directly to Nebula Graph, it could optionally generate SST files to be ingested into Nebula Graph to offload the storage computation outside of the Nebula Graph cluster.</li>
<li>Nebula Algorithm, built on top of Nebula Spark Connector and GraphX, is a Spark Lib and Application to run de facto graph algorithms(PageRank, LPA, etc&hellip;) on a graph from Nebula Graph.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then let&rsquo;s have the long version of those spark projects more on how-to perspectives.</p>
<h2 id="spark-connector" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#spark-connector" class="header-mark"></a>2 Spark-Connector</h2><ul>
<li>Codebase: <a href="https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-spark-connector" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-spark-connector</a></li>

</ul>
<h3 id="nebula-graph-spark-reader" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#nebula-graph-spark-reader" class="header-mark"></a>2.1 Nebula Graph Spark Reader</h3><p>To read data from Nebula Graph, i.e. vertex, Nebula Spark Connector will scan all storage instances that hold the given label(TAG): <code>withLabel(&quot;player&quot;)</code>, and we could optionally specify the properties of the vertex: <code>withReturnCols(List(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;age&quot;))</code>.</p>
<p>With needed configuration being provided, a call of <code>spark.read.nebula.loadVerticesToDF</code> will return dataframe of the Vertex Scan call towards Nebula Graph:</p>

<p>Nebula Exchange is a Spark Lib/App to read data from multiple sources, then, write to either Nebula Graph directly or into Nebula Graph <a href="https://docs.nebula-graph.io/3.0.2/nebula-exchange/use-exchange/ex-ug-import-from-sst/#step_5_import_the_sst_file" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SST Files</a>.</p>

<p>The way to leverage Nebula Exchange is only to firstly create the configuration files to let the exchange know how data should be fetched and written, then call the exchange package with the conf file specified.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s do a hands-on test with the same environment created in the last chapter.</p>

    <a href="#calling-as-a-lib-in-code" class="header-mark"></a>4.2 Calling as a lib in code</h3><p>On the other hand, we could call Nebula Algorithm in spark as a Spark Lib, the gain will be:</p>
<ol>
<li>More control/customization on the output format of the algorithm</li>
<li>Possible to perform algorithm for non-numerical vertex ID cases, see <a href="https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-algorithm/blob/a82d7092d928a2f3abc45a727c24afb888ff8e4f/example/src/main/scala/com/vesoft/nebula/algorithm/PageRankExample.scala#L48" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></li>

    <a href="#pyspark-for-nebula-graph" class="header-mark"></a>5 PySpark for Nebula Graph</h2><p>PySpark comes with the capability to call java/scala packages inside python, thus it&rsquo;s also quite easy to use Spark Connector with Python.</p>
<p>Here I am doing this from the pyspark entrypoint in <code>/spark/bin/pyspark</code>, with the connector&rsquo;s Jar package specified with <code>--driver-class-path</code> and <code>--jars</code></p>

<p>With the ARM64 Docker Image of Nebula Graph, it&rsquo;s actually quite easy to run it on SBC/Respberry Pi!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="background" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#background" class="header-mark"></a>1 Background</h2><p>Recently, after Yee from Nebula Graph Community fixed ARM build on <a href="https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-third-party/pull/37" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nebula-third-party#37</a>, we could play with Nebula Graph on M1 Chip Macbook. While, I didn&rsquo;t get the chance to run it on a SBC/Pi.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks before, in a twitter thread with <a href="https://twitter.com/laixintao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@laixintao</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/andelf/status/1504295476958404608" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@andelf</a> I decided to purchase a <a href="https://wiki.radxa.com/Rock3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rock Pi 3A</a>:</p>

    </a></p>
<p>And it looks nice!(Even come with a NPU inside)</p>

<p>Actually, since v3.0.0, Nebula comes with a <a href="https://docs.nebula-graph.io/3.0.1/4.deployment-and-installation/standalone-deployment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standalone version</a>, which suits the deep edge deployment more, but today, I will only setup the cluster version as the Docker Image is out of box to be used. I will share more on standalone version in upcoming weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I put the Ubuntu Server installation steps in the appendix, and now I assumed we already have an ARM64 Linux up and running on a Pi SBC.</p>

    <a href="#wordle-solver" class="header-mark"></a>1.1 Wordle Solver</h3><p>For all magics being used to solve wordle, I am impressed by <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grant Sanderson</a>, who explained us the information theory when solving wordle, <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/wordle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in an elegent and delightful way</a>.</p>
<h3 id="chinese-wordle-handle" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#chinese-wordle-handle" class="header-mark"></a>1.2 Chinese wordle: &ldquo;handle&rdquo;</h3><p>I am not going create yet another wordle-solver today, instead, it&rsquo;s more about an intresting variant of wordle.</p>
<p>To truly enjoy the fun of wordle, mostly we should be a native speaker, and it is not surprising that there is a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=wordle%20es" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spanish wordle</a> out there, and still tweets on wordle(es) are being shared literially every second now.</p>
<p>While for non alphabetic languages like Chineses, do we have the luck to have fun with wordling? The answer is yes, while it&rsquo;s a bit different.</p>
<p>For the reason <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_characters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chinese charactors</a>, also called Hanzi or Han chactors are in from of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Logogram</a>, each charactor in Chinese is made up of radicals in quite different forms, each Chinese word can be 2/3/4 charactors. Most of the crossword games in Chinese are idiom, proverb or ancient poetry based: the slot to be filled are one Chinese.</p>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s5ZBf.png" title="Chinese Idiom Puzzle" data-thumbnail="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s5ZBf.png">

<p>ref: <a href="https://chinese.stackexchange.com/questions/42416/chinese-idiom-puzzle-14-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E5%A1%AB%E5%AD%97%E9%81%8A%E6%88%B2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chinese idiom puzzle</a></p>
<p>Thus, a wordle but in Chinese idiom will be quite strange, or even hilarious as <a href="https://cheeaun.com/blog/2022/02/chengyu-wordle-is-not-a-love-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chee</a> and JinGen discussed in this <a href="https://twitter.com/jg_lim/status/1484506430711697412" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet thread</a>, where you could see the candidate characters are counted in thousands: there is no chance to guess the idiom in 10 attempts!</p>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="./wordle-but-in-Chinese-idioms.webp" title="wordle-but-in-Chinese-idioms" data-thumbnail="./wordle-but-in-Chinese-idioms.webp">
        
    </a></p>
<p>As one of the fun on playing wordle could be the feedback loop of <code>guess --&gt; result</code> in limited attempts, while the scale of Chinese Charactor had pushed the Chinese wordle variant creators leveraging other aspects of the charactor: pronunciation.</p>
<p>Each charactor in Chinease is monosyllabic without exceptions, and when it comes to its pronunciation, they are all made up from two parts(initial and final, and they could be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">written in roman letters</a>), which comes in tens level of possbilities.</p>
<p>There are bounch of Chinese wordle varients asking player to guess idiom leveraging pinyin:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pinyincaichengyu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://pinyincaichengyu.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cheeaun.github.io/chengyu-wordle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://cheeaun.github.io/chengyu-wordle/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/id1606194420" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/id1606194420</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While, to me, a native Chinese speaker, it&rsquo;s either too hard to play with condtions of pronunciation parts(pinyin) or too easy to guess on given around 20 Chinese charactors. Then, the varient stands out here is the &ldquo;<a href="handle/%e6%b1%89%e5%85%9c" rel="">handle/汉兜</a>&quot;(Hanzi-Wordle) created by <a href="https://antfu.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Antfu</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Handle&rdquo; introduced the tones with genius to add an extra dimension of all charactors per each guess attempt, which helped player to have more information on filtering the knowledge in the brain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note, for each Chinese charactor, there will be a tone in 1 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_tones_%28Middle_Chinese%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4 tones</a> in its pronunciation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what it&rsquo;s like to play the &ldquo;Handle&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be 4 Chinese Charactors to be filled in 10 times of guess</li>
<li>Not only the charactor self will be colored in result:
<ul>
<li>For example in first line, the green &ldquo;门&rdquo; in position 2 is correct whereas in second line, the orange &ldquo;仓&rdquo; is corret while the possition should be all but not the first slot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There will be extra hints on:
<ul>
<li>Pinyin parts for both part1(initial) and part2(final)
<ul>
<li>In third line of the boxes, the green &ldquo;qiao&rdquo; refers to the first charactor is ponouced in &ldquo;qiao&rdquo; with initial:&ldquo;q&rdquo; and final:&ldquo;iao&rdquo;, although we filled the wrong charactor in the writing dimension.</li>
<li>In third line, the orange &ldquo;uo&rdquo; refers to there is one chacarctor in other poisition with the final part of the pinyin as &ldquo;uo&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tones of the charactor:
<ul>
<li>In third line, the green &ldquo;-&rdquo; stands for the third charactor is in tone-1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-chinese-wordle-helper" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-chinese-wordle-helper" class="header-mark"></a>1.3 The Chinese Wordle Helper</h3><p>As a non-native English speaker, the way I was playing wordle is to <del>cheating</del> relying on helpers:</p>
<p>After knowing on the third letter to be &ldquo;O&rdquo;, I googled and got this: <a href="https://uppolice.org/5-letter-words-with-o-in-the-middle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5-letter-words-with-o-in-the-middle</a> and do the searching 😁.</p>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="./wordle-en-play.webp" title="wordle-en-play" data-thumbnail="./wordle-en-play.webp">
        
    </a></p>
<p>The way to play with helpers works for me to have fun yet not ruin it by an automated cheat resolver(it&rsquo;s only simulating my brain as a native-speaker!), so that I could somehow experience the same as Millions of people out there without cheating.</p>
<p>While for Chinese &ldquo;Handle&rdquo; players, from my perspective, it&rsquo;s still a bit harder(to find answers in 10 guesses), and the way my wife and I were playing &ldquo;Handle&rdquo; when lining up at the restaurant door ended up googling: idiom list with word &lsquo;foo&rsquo;, yet still having a lot of fun.</p>
<h2 id="chinese-idiom-knowledge-graph" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#chinese-idiom-knowledge-graph" class="header-mark"></a>2 Chinese idiom Knowledge Graph</h2><p>Could I create something between the human brain and the game-cheater/ruiner to make it more of fun?</p>
<p>The answer is yes: a game extension as a secondary brain. For this helper/secondary brain, the solution for &ldquo;handle&rdquo; differenciates from the English wordle, unlike the auto-solver, similar algorithms could help on both cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In wordle(English), player searches in their brain or from a helper like the web page: <a href="https://uppolice.org/5-letter-words-with-o-in-the-middle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5-letter-words-with-o-in-the-middle</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In handle(Chinese), it&rsquo;s harder to be searching based on hints like tones/initial parts of pinyin in fulltext webpage searching anymore, the reason hehind is that the multidimensional filter condtions are not indexed by normal webpages. As I mentioned, the key of the helper to be leveraged to (not ruining the game) is to be the extension of the brain, then the question is: how does our brain work on handling the knowledge of &ldquo;handle&rdquo;(yes, I was preparing for this pun for so long!)?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, why not do it in a graph/neural network way? And here we go, let&rsquo;s create a knowledge graph of Chinese idiom and see how it goes with the &ldquo;handle&rdquo; game.</p>
<h3 id="tldr" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#tldr" class="header-mark"></a>2.1 TL;DR</h3><p>It&rsquo;s indeed entertaining to me, and I could write Graph Queries[*] by hand or via Visualization tools[**] to help explore things in this graph, because <del>I can</del> we&rsquo;re doing the &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; process the similar way in our own brain, but not so well-informed.</p>

    <a href="#play-handle-with-knowledge-graph" class="header-mark"></a>2.2.1 Play Handle with Knowledge Graph</h4><p>So, if we visit the &ldquo;handle&rdquo; game 👉🏻 <a href="https://handle.antfu.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://handle.antfu.me/</a>. We could start with one guess i.e. &ldquo;爱憎分明&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We will get hint of the first guess as:</p>
<p><a class="lightgallery" href="./initial_word.webp" title="./initial_word.webp" data-thumbnail="./initial_word.webp">
        
    </a></p>
<p>Not bad, we have three of the charactor with informative hints!</p>
<ul>
<li>There is one Character not in 1st position, with tone-4, final part as &ldquo;ai&rdquo;, but is not &ldquo;爱&rdquo;</li>
<li>There is one Character in tone-1 not in 2nd position</li>
<li>There is one Character with final part as &ldquo;ing&rdquo;, not in 4th position</li>
<li>The 4th Character is tone-2</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we just query it from Nebula Graph:</p>

<p>You will come back to iterate or optimize the modeling when you are actually playing with the data afterwards, thus, if you could imagine how the graph will be queried in the first place, the graph modeling could be adopted accordingly. Otherwise, don&rsquo;t over design it, just do it the intuitive way.</p>
<p>Here, I put the vertices with properties as:</p>

<p>Nebula Graph Native Index explained, why <code>index not found</code>? When should I use Nebula Index and full-text index?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The term of Nebula Graph Index is quite similar to the index in RDBMS, while, they are not the same. It&rsquo;s noticed that when getting started with Nebula Graph, the index confused some of the users in first glance on the following</p>
<ul>
<li>What exactly Nebula Graph Index is.</li>
<li>When I should use it.</li>
<li>How it impacts the performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today I&rsquo;m gonna walk you through the index in Nebula Graph.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get started!</p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-nebula-graph-index-is" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#what-exactly-nebula-graph-index-is" class="header-mark"></a>1 What exactly Nebula Graph Index is</h2><p>TL;DR, Nebula Graph Index is only to be used to enable the graph query to be <strong>started from</strong> conditions on <strong>properties</strong> of vertices or edges, instead of vertexID.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only used in a starting entry of a graph query. If a query is in pattern: (a-&gt;b-&gt;c, where c in condition-foobar) graph walk, due to the only filtering <code>condition-foobar</code> is on <code>c</code>, this query under the hood will be started to seek <code>c</code>, and then it walks through the reversed <code>-&gt;</code> to <code>b</code>, finally to <code>a</code>. Thus, the Nebula Graph Index will be used and only be possbily used in seeking c, when <code>condition-foobar</code> is not like <code>id(c) == &quot;foobar&quot;</code> but <code>c.property_x == &quot;foobar&quot;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="index-is-used-only-for-starting-point-seek" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#index-is-used-only-for-starting-point-seek" class="header-mark"></a>1.1 Index is used only for starting point seek</h3><p>We know that in RDBMS, an INDEX is to create a duplicated sorted DATA to enable QUERY with condition filtering on the sorted data, to <strong>accelerate the query in read</strong> and involves extra writes during the write.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: in RDBMS/Tabular DB, an INDEX on some columns means to create extra data that are sorted on those columns to make query with those columns&rsquo; condition to be scanned faster, rather than scanning from the original table data sorted based on the key only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Nebula Graph, the INDEX is to create a duplicated sorted <strong>Vertex/Edge PROP DATA</strong> to <strong>enable starting point seek of a QUERY</strong>(it&rsquo;s a prerequisite rather than help accelerate it).</p>
<p>Not all of the queries relied on index, here are some examples, let&rsquo;s call them pure-property-condition-start queries:</p>

</div><p>If we look into <code>query 1</code> and <code>query 3</code>, which shared condition on vertex on <code>tag:player</code> are both <code>{ name: 'Tim Duncan' }</code> though, they are differenciated in starting points:</p>
<p>For <code>query 3</code> , the index is not required as the query will be started from known vertex ID in <code>[&quot;player101&quot;, &quot;player102&quot;]</code> and thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;ll directly fetch vertex Data from <code>v2</code>&rsquo;s vertex IDs</li>
<li>then to GetNeighbors(): walk through edges of <code>v2</code>, GetVertices() for next hop: <code>v</code> and filter based on property: <code>name</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For <code>query 1</code> , the query has to start from <code>v</code> due to no known vertex IDs were provided:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;ll do IndexScan() first to find all vertices only with property condtion of <code>{ name: 'Tim Duncan' }</code></li>
<li>Then, GetNeighbors(): walk through edges of <code>v</code>, GetVertices() for next hop: <code>v2</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we could know the whole point that matters here is on <strong>whether to know the vertexID</strong>. And the above differences could be shown in their execution plans with PROFILE or EXPLAIN like the follow:</p>
<table>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible in theory with full scan, but disabled without index.</p>
<p>The reason is Nebula Graph stores data in a distributed and graph-oriented way, the full scan of data was condiserred too expensive to be allowed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: from v3.0, it&rsquo;s possible to do TopN Scan without INDEX, where the <code>LIMIT &lt;n&gt;</code> is used, this is different from the fullscan case(INDEX is a must), which will be explained later.</p>

    <a href="#why-starting-point-only" class="header-mark"></a>1.3 Why starting point only</h3><p>Index data is not used in terversal. It could confuse use to think of index is to sorting data based on properties, does it accelerate the terversal with property condition filtering? The answer is, no.</p>
<p>In Nebula Graph, the data is structured in a way to enable fast graph-terversal, which is already indexed/sorted on vertex ID(for both vertex and edge) in raw data, where terversal(underlying in storage, it&rsquo;s calling GetNeighbors interface) of given vertex is cheap and fast due to the locality/stored continuously(pysically linked).</p>
<p>So in summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nebula Graph Index is sorted prop data to find the starting vertex or edge on given pure prop conditions.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Index Data is stored and sharded together with Vertex Data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s <strong>Left Match</strong> based only: It&rsquo;s RocksDB Prefix Scan under the hood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effect on write and read path(to see its cost):</p>
<ul>
<li>Write Path: Extra Data written + Extra Read request introduced</li>
<li>Read Path: RBO(Rule based optimization), Fan Out(to all shards)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>

<p>We should notice that only the left match is supported in pure-property-condition-start queries. For queries like wildcard or reguler-expression, Full-text Index/Search is to be used, where an external elastic search is integrated with nebula: please check <a href="https://docs.nebula-graph.io/3.1.0/4.deployment-and-installation/6.deploy-text-based-index/2.deploy-es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nebula Graph Full text index</a> for more.</p>

<p>Within this sketch note, more highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Local Index Design</p>
<ul>
<li>The index is stored and shared locally together with the graph data.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s sorting based on prop value, and the index search is underlying a rocksDB prefix scan, that&rsquo;s why only left match is supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is cost in the write path</p>
<ul>
<li>The index enables the RDBMS-like Prop Condition Based Query with cost in the write path including not only the extra write, but also, random read, to ensure the data consistency.</li>
<li>Index Data write is done in a sync way</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Read path:</p>
<ul>
<li>In pure-property-condition-start queries, in GraphD, the index will be selected with Rule-based-optimization like this example, where, in a rule, the col2 to be sorted first is considered optimal with the condition: col2 equals &lsquo;foo&rsquo;.</li>
<li>After the index was chosen, index-scan request will be fanout to storageD instances, and in the case of filters like LIMIT N, it will be pushed down to the storage side to reduce data payload.
<ul>
<li>Note: it was not shown in the sketch but actually from v3.0, the nebula graph allows LIMIT N Sample Prop condition query like this w/o index, which is underlying pushing down the LIMIT filter to storage side.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Take aways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use index only when we have to, as it&rsquo;s costly in write cases and if limit N sample is the only needed case and it&rsquo;s fast enough, we can use that instead.</li>
<li>Index is left match
<ul>
<li>composite index order matters, should be created carefully.</li>
<li>for full-text search use case, use <a href="https://docs.nebula-graph.io/3.1.0/4.deployment-and-installation/6.deploy-text-based-index/2.deploy-es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full-text index</a> instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-use-the-index" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#how-to-use-the-index" class="header-mark"></a>3 How to use the index</h2><p>We should always refer to the <a href="https://docs.nebula-graph.io/3.1.0/3.ngql-guide/14.native-index-statements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a>, and I just put some highlights on this here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To create an index on a tag or edge type to specify a list of props in the order that we need.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CREATE INDEX</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an index was created after existing data was inserted, we need to trigger an index async rebuild job, as the index data will be written in sync way only when index is created.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>REBUILD INDEX</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can see the index status after <code>REBUILD INDEX</code> issued.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SHOW INDEX STATUS</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Queries levering index could be LOOKUP, and with the pipeline, in most cases we will do follow-up graph-walk queries like:</p>

    <a href="#conclusion" class="header-mark"></a>4 Conclusion</h2><ul>
<li>If we go with JSON response, it&rsquo;ll be easier for you to have everything parsed.</li>
<li>If we have to deal with resultSet object, just use the ValueWrapper asNode() if the value is a vertex, use asRelationship if value is an edge and asPath() if the value is a path.
<ul>
<li>With the REPL tool shown together with java reflection and source code, it&rsquo;s possbile to inspect on how data could be parsed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy Graphing!</p>

<p>The Backend(Siwi API) is a Flask based API server:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Flask API server takes questions in HTTP POST, and calls the bot API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In bot API part there are classfier(Symentic Parsing, Intent Matching, Slot Filling), and question actors(Call corresponding actions to query Knowledge Graph with intents and slots).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge Graph is built on an Open-Source Graph Database: <a href="https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-graph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nebula Graph</a></p>

<p>The Frontend is a VueJS Single Page Applicaiton(SPA):</p>
