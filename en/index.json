When should I use Nebula Index and full-text index? The term of Nebula Graph Index is quite similar to index in RDBMS, while, they are not the same. It’s noticed when getting started with Nebula Graph, the index confused some of the users in first glance on What exactly Nebula Graph Index is. When I should use it. How it impacts the performance.

Note: in RDBMS/Tabular DB, an INDEX on some columns means to create extra data that are sorted on those columns to make query with those columns' condition to be scanned faster, rather than scanning from the original table data sorted based on the key only. In Nebula Graph, the INDEX is to create a duplicated sorted Vertex/Edge PROP DATA to enable the part of QUERY(it’s a must rather than accelerate it) like The following to GET data from PROP Conditions: or I call it the pure-prop-condition queries: ####QueriesrelyingonNebulaGraphIndex#query0pure-prop-conditionqueryLOOKUPONtag1WHEREcol1\u003e1ANDcol2==\"foo\"\\YIELDtag1.col1ascol1,tag1.col3ascol3;#query1pure-prop-conditionqueryMATCH(v:player{name:'Tim Duncan'})--\u003e(v2:player) \\ RETURNv2.player.nameASName; The pure-prop-condition queries, like above nGQL lines are literally to “Find VID/EDGE only based on given the propertiy condtions”. On the contrary, the following, are not pure-prop-condition queries: ####QueriesnotbasedonNebulaGraphIndex#query2,walkquerystartingfromgivenvertexVID:\"player100\"GOFROM\"player100\"OVERfollowREVERSELY\\YIELDsrc(edge)ASid|\\GOFROM$-.idOVERserve\\WHEREproperties($^).age\u003e20\\YIELDproperties($^).nameASFriendOf,properties($$).nameASTeam;#query3,walkquerystartingfromgivenvertexVID:\"player101\"or\"player102\"MATCH(v:player{name:'Tim Duncan'})--(v2) \\ WHEREid(v2)IN[\"player101\",\"player102\"]\\RETURNv2.player.nameASName; If we look into query 1 and query 3, where condition on vertex on tag:player are both { name: 'Tim Duncan' } though: For query 3 , the index is not required as the query will be started from known vertex ID in [\"player101\", \"player102\"] and thus: It’ll directly fetch vertex Data from v2’s vertex IDs then to GetNeighbors(): walk through edges of v2, GetVertices() for next hop: v and filter based on property: name For query 1 , the query has to start from v due to no known vertex IDs were provided: It’ll do IndexScan() first to find all vertices only with property condtion of { name: 'Tim Duncan' } Then, GetNeighbors(): walk through edges of v, GetVertices() for next hop: v2 Now, we could know the whole point is on whether to know the vertexID(s). You could check their execution plan with PROFILE or EXPLAIN like the follow: query 1, requires/based on index(on tag: player), pure prop condition query query 3, no index required, query starting from known vertex IDs ","date":"2022-02-20","objectID":"/en/nebula-index-explained/:1:1","series":null,"tags":["Nebula Graph","index","search","graph database"],"title":"Nebula Index Explained","uri":"/en/nebula-index-explained/#pure-prop-condition-queries"},{"categories":["Nebula Graph"],"content":"1.2 Why Nebula Graph index is a must in pure-prop-condition queriesIt’s because Nebula Graph stores data in a distributed and graph-oriented way, the full scan of data was condiser too expensive to be allowed(index not found will occur when it’s not created in pure-prop-condition queries). Note: from v3.0, it’s possible to do TopN Scan without INDEX, where the LIMIT \u003cn\u003e is used, this is different from the fullscan case(INDEX is a must), which will be explained later.

So in summary: Nebula Graph Index is sorted prop data to find vertex or edge on given pure prop conditions.

For queries like wildcard or reguler-expression, Full-text Index/Search is to be used, which leveraged an external elastic search integrated with nebula: please check Nebula Graph Full text index for more. With this sketch note, we could see Local Index Design The index is stored and shared locally together with the graph data. It’s sorting based on prop value, and the matching is underlying a rocksDB prefix scan, that’s why only left match is supported() Write path The index enables the RDBMS-like Prop Condition Query with cost in the write path including not only the extra write, but also, random read, to ensure the data consistency. Index Data write is done in a sync way Read path In pure-prop-condition queries, in GraphD, the index will be selected with Rule-based-optimization like this example, where, in a rule, the col2 to be sorted first is considered optimal with the condition: col2 equals ‘foo’. After the index was chosen, index-scan request will be fanout to storageD instances, and in the case of filters like LIMIT N, it will be pushed down to the storage side to reduce data payload. Note: not shown in the sketch but actually from v3.0, the nebula graph allows LIMIT N Sample Prop condition query like this w/o index, which is underlying pushing down the LIMIT filter to storage side. Take aways: Use index only when we have to, as it’s costly in write cases and if limit N sample is allowed and fast enough, we can use that instead, if not: use index. Index is left match composite index order matters, should be created carefully. for full-text search use case, use full-text index instead.

CREATE INDEX If an index was created after existing data was inserted, we need to trigger an index async rebuild job, as the index data will be written in sync way only when index is created. REBUILD INDEX We can see the index status after REBUILD INDEX issued.

For Nebula Graph Database, plesae refer to Doc , Doc-CN to deploy on any Linux Servers, for study and test, you can run it via Docker following the Quick Start Chapter of the documentation. For Nebula-Importer, if you already have Docker env, you can run it as the following without installing anything.

Pulsar，更多的数据源也在不断增加之中）。 如上图所示，在 Exchange 内部，从除了不同 Reader 可以读取不同数据源之外，在数据经过 Processor 处理之后通过 Writer写入（sink） Nebula Graph 图数据库的时候，除了走正常的 ServerBaseWriter 的写入流程之外，它还可以绕过整个写入流程，利用 Spark 的计算能力并行生成底层 RocksDB 的 SST 文件，从而实现超高性能的数据导入，这个 SST 文件导入的场景就是本文带大家上手熟悉的部分。 详细信息请参阅：Nebula Graph 手册:什么是 Nebula Exchange Nebula Graph 官方博客也有更多 Nebula Exchange 的实践文章

How to explore Chia Network? 如何探索 Chia 链随着我们之前分析的信息，自然地，我们可以把 Chia 区块链中的信息取出来，用图（Graph）来表示，这里的图并不是（Graphic）图形、图画的意思，是数学、图论中的图。 在图的语境下，最主要的两个元素就是顶点（Vertex）和边（Edge）。 顶点表示一个实体，而边表示实体之间的某种关系，这种关系可以是对等的（无方向的）也可以是有方向的。 这里我们可以把这里的信息抽象映射到如图的图模型里： Block 顶点 Coin 顶点 Puzzle 顶点 spends 边（Block 到 Coin） confirms 边 （Block 到 Coin） belongs_to 边（Coin 到 Puzzle） 这里，我们应用的图是一种叫做属性图的形式，除了点和边的关系之外。这两种实体（点、边）还有其他信息只和它们的一个实例相关，所以再定义为顶点、边就不是很适合，这些信息就作为点、边的属性（preperty）存在。 这种为了处理实体之间关联、涉及实体、关联的属性信息的，也就是\"属性图\"的存储信息的方式在计算机领域越来越流行，甚至有专门为此结构而原生开发的数据库——图数据库（Graph Database）。 这里，我们用的就是一个叫做 Nebula Graph 的图数据库，它是一个现代的、为超大规模分部署架构设计的、原生存储、查询、计算图数据的项目，更棒的是，它是产生于社区的开源产品。 Tips: 安装 Nebula Graph 一般来说，面向超大规模数据的分布式系统，天然的都是不容易轻量部署的，大家如果第一次使用的话可以试试我写的一个叫做 nebula-up 的小工具，可以一行指令部署一个用来试用、学习的 Nebula Graph 集群，地址在这里： https://github.com/wey-gu/nebula-up/ 。 ","date":"2021-05-26","objectID":"/en/nebula-chia/:3:0","series":null,"tags":["Nebula Graph","Chia Network"],"title":"Explore Chia Network in a Visualized Way","uri":"/en/nebula-chia/#3-how-to-explore-chia-network-如何探索-chia-链"},{"categories":["Nebula Graph"],"content":"3.1 3.1 Import the Chia to a Graph Database, Nebula Graph 导入 Chia 数据到图数据库我们分两步走，第一步这把 Chia Network 数据转换成 CSV 文件，第二步使用 Nebula 的 Nebula-Importer 把数据导入 Nebula Graph。 3.1.1 3.1.1 Data conversion 数据转换这部分的代码我开源在这里了: https://github.com/wey-gu/nebula-chia 使用它只需要在 Chia Network 的 python venv 下安装它: python3 -m pip install nebula-chia 然后调用 ChaiBatchConvertor 就可以在当前目录下生成两个 CSV 文件。 这里边有一些可以配置的参数，具体可以参考代码 nebulachia/convertor.py from nebulachia.convertor import ChiaBatchConvertor c = ChaiBatchConvertor( block_record_limit=0, coin_record_limit=0, write_batch_size=10000) c.convert_block_record() c.convert_coin_record() 生成的文件： $ ls -lth -rw-r--r-- 1 weyl staff 173M May 19 13:01 coin_record.csv -rw-r--r-- 1 weyl staff 77M May 19 12:59 block_record.csv 这里边字段的含义和类型，可以参考代码中 block_record_row 和 coin_record_row 的 __doc__ In [466]: print(c.coin_record_row.__doc__) Parse row and return a CSV block coin row list.

搭建数据管道，收集探索开源社区洞察。并将全部代码开源在 GitHub。 引子 我们想要收集一些帮助 Nebula Graph 社区运营的 metrics，希望能从不同来源的数据自动化周期性收集、处理、并方便地展现出来做数据驱动分析的基础设施。 Nebula Graph 是一个现代的开源分布式图数据库(Graph Database)，欢迎同学们从: 官网:

query，展示数据的界面: Data-UI 这个需求的特点是虽然数据量很小、但是要求服务高可用、安全。因为这种情况下自建服务器还需要保证HA和数据安全会一定会消耗昂贵运维人力，所以我们应该尽量避免在自己维护的服务器中搭建 scheduler, 和数据库。 最终，我们选择了尽量使用公有云的 aaS 的方案: ┌──────────────────────────┐ │ │ │ Google Cloud Scheduler │ │ │ └────────────┬─────────────┘ │ ┌─────────────────────┐ │ │ │ ┌────────────▼─────────────┐ ┌───────────► GitHub API Server │ │ │ │ │ │ │ Google Cloud Functions ├───┤

Data Studio │ │ ┌──┐ │ │ ┌──┐ │ │ ┌──┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ └──┴──┴─┴──┴─┴──┴──────┘ 因为我个人比较熟悉 Google Cloud Platform(GCP)的原因，加上GCP在大数据处理上比较领先，再加上Google提供的 free tier额度非常大方，以至于在我们这个数据量下，所有workload都会是免费的。 这个方案最后选择了全栈 Google Cloud，然而，这实际上只是一个参考，同学们完全可以在其他公有云提供商那里找到对应的服务。 这里我简单介绍一下， Google Cloud Scheduler是自解释的，不用多介绍了。 而 Google Cloud Functions是GCP的无服务器(serverless)的 Function as a Service服务，它的好处是我们可以把无状态的 event-driven 的 workload 代码放上去，它是按需付费（pay as you go)的，类似的服务还有 Google Cloud Run，后者的区别在于我们提供的是一个docker/container（这使得能支持的运行环境可以使任何能跑在容器里的东西），而 Cloud Functions是把我们的代码文件放上去。他们的效果是类似的，因为我准备用Python来做 ETL的东西，Clouf Functions已经支持了，我就直接选择它了。 在scheduler里边，我定义了每一天它发一个 pub/sub（类似于kafka，这里google可以保证至少发成功一次）消息给 Cloud Functions，然后 Cloud Functions会去做 ETL的工作。 这里，实际上我的设计里这个触发的函数调会把数据从API那里获取下来，在内存里处理好之后，存储到在对象存储里为 JSON 文件，然后再调用 Google BigQuery 的 API让 BigQuery直接从对对象存储里拉取 JSON 文件，导入记录到相应的表之中。 Google BigQuery 作为GCP 特别有竞争力的一个产品，是它数据仓库，BigQuery 可以无限扩容，支持海量数据导入，支持 SQL-like 的 query，还自带ML算法，通过SQL就能调用这些算法。它可以和很多GCP以及第三方的组件可以集成起来。 Google Data Studio 是GCP的数据 Insights产品，如果大家用过 Google Analytics 应该已经用过它了。 ","date":"2021-05-03","objectID":"/en/nebula-insights/:1:1","series":null,"tags":["Nebula Graph","serverless","Cloud","FaaS"],"title":"Nebula-Insights, How we leverage

总结这样，我们实际上不需要任何认为维护的成本和投入，就搭建了一整个数据的流水线，并且只需要按照数据用量付费，在我们的数据量下，及时考虑未来增加数十个新的量度的收集，我们依然没有达到需要付费的用量，是不是很Cool？ 因为数据同时存在于对象存储与数仓里，我们可以方便随时把数据导入任意其他平台上。 BigQuery还有一些非常常用的，自带的机器学习的功能，只需要写一个SQL-Like的query就能触发然后获得预测结果，如果我们用到这些功能的话也会回到 datawhale 为同学们继续分享哈。 第一次做数据工程方面的分享，如果有错误的地方欢迎大家不吝指出哈~~ 谢谢！
