## Nebula-Operator-Kind

As a Cloud Native Distributed Database, Nebula Graph comes with an open-source [K8s Operator](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-operator) to enable boostrap and maintain Nebula Graph Cluster from a K8s CRD.

Normally it takes you some time to setup all the dependencies and control plane resources of the Nebula Operator. If you are as lazy as I am, this Nebula-Operator-Kind is made for you to quick start and play with Nebula Graph in [KIND](https://kind.sigs.K8s.io/).

Nebula-Operator-Kind is the one-liner for setup everything for you including:
- Docker
- K8s(KIND)
- PV Provider
- Nebula-Operator
- Nebula-Console
- nodePort for accessing the Cluster
- Kubectl for playing with KIND and Nebula Operator

## How To Use
Install Nebula-Operator-Kind:
```bash
curl -sL nebula-kind.siwei.io/install.sh | bash
```
You will see this after it's done
![install_success](./install_success.webp)

You can connect to the cluster via `~/.nebula-kind/bin/console` as below:
```bash
~/.nebula-kind/bin/console -u user -p password --address=127.0.0.1 --port=30000
```
