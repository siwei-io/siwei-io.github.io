# Hi, this is Wey :)

I am a developer @***[vesoft](https://vesoft.com)*** working as Developer Advocate of [Nebula Graph](https://nebula-graph.com.cn/), the open source distributed Graph Database

I create toolings and content for [Nebula Graph Database](https://github.com/vesoft-inc) to help Developers in the open source community.

I am working in open source and consider it is a privilege [^1]. It took me a couple of my early career years to figure out that my passion lies in *helping others with my thoughts & the tech/magic I have learned*.

## Previous work

I worked at Ericsson for amost 10 years(2011 to 2021).
As the System Manager [^3] of Cloud Execution Envrioment (CEE) [^2] PDU Cloud, member of CEE 10 core team and CEE System Management team. Helping evolve CEE was my main job: I studied, designed and implemented more than 20 features for CEE 6.6.2 and CEE 10, including area of compute, network, storage, lifecycle management and security.
I am also responsible for Ericsson CEE evangelism (internal and external) in China.

I used to share my notes and thoughts on [note.siwei.info](https://note.siwei.info/archives/), while from 2021, I will leave more ideas on [siwei.io](https://siwei.io) instead.
